<h3 class=”bot”>b. Beliefs and Opinions on the topic</h3>
<p class=”pbot”>The majority of our respondents believed that the double standards against women stemmed from the Spanish colonization’s introduction to their patriarchal culture, which shaped the ways our society has discriminated against women for generations. Because of this, most Filipinos have maintained their traditional beliefs and continue to underestimate what women are and aren't capable of, for they believe that men are natural-born leaders while women are expected to take on supporting roles in favor of the patriarchy; many women’s accomplishments in history have been overshadowed due to sexism.</p>
<h3 class=”at”> c.Attitudes on the topic
    <p class= “pat”> Our respondents had similar opinions about the double standards; the majority of them were upset and deemed it as unfair for both men and women; they believe that reinforcing harmful gender stereotypes will hold back the process of how we can progress as a society. By tolerating these toxic gender norms, we limit everyone's potential by telling them what they can and can't be solely based on their gender identity.</p>

    <h1 class=”p5”> Finding a need for viewers in a streaming category</h1>
    <p class= “pp”>Based on the results of our audience analysis from Q1, gaming has won the majority vote for being the most appropriate to use for our topic in Q1. While viewers enjoy watching the video game stream for entertainment, they can also learn new tips, tricks, and strategies that can improve their gameplay. By watching how the streamer plays different challenges, makes a certain move, and makes strategic decisions, the viewers will gain something helpful when they play the game themselves. This allows them to not only enjoy the content but also enhance their own skills and understanding of the game. Based on our experience and the quality of the video, The most appropriate platform for our content type  is YouTube</p>
